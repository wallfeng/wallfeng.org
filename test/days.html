            <p><strong>Youth Lagoon</strong></p>
            
            <p>Trevor Powers, the artist behind Youth Lagoon, showcased his excellent new album <em>Heaven Is a Junkyard</em> on the Green Stage on Friday. His vocal performance was both vulnerable and disembodied, and he played synths and keys alongside a bassist and guitarist/drummer. Before playing “Trapeze Artist,” Powers told the audience that he wrote the song at a time when nothing made sense anymore, when he had finally “come face to face with the devil.” Now, though, the band seemed at peace: through the slow, resplendent build of oldie “Montana” and the quietly massive closer “Mercury,” when Powers left the keyboard and came up to the front of the stage, bringing us in. <em>—Mika Simoncelli & Benjy Wall-Feng</em></p>

            <p><strong>Perfume Genius</strong></p>
            
            <p>Perfume Genius, the project of artist Mike Hadreas, gave a stunning performance on the Green Stage, playing a set that highlighted their best-known and most danceable songs. On the stage Hadreas’s movements were sometimes loose and jumping, unchoreographed. In other moments they were sculptural and timed perfectly, such as on “Otherside,” when he dropped into a backbend, microphone aloft, in sync with the instruments crashing in. In one of the few quieter moments of the set, he performed “Jason” from a chair, singing in flawless falsetto. Hadreas closed his set with the genderqueer anthem “Queen,” from 2014. He held the chair above his head triumphantly, his body covered in gold tulle that he had brought to decorate the stage, and sang the song’s standout lyric: “No family is safe when I sashay.” <em>—Mika Simoncelli</em></p>

            <p><strong>Leikeli47</strong></p>
            
            <p>At Leikeli47’s set we felt like we had been transported to a different festival. The set overlapped with the band Alvvays, which was on the larger Red Stage — the audience that chose to see Leikeli47 was made up of devoted fans who were ready to dance. Her set was the standout among all of the excellent performances we saw on Friday. The rapper brought an unstoppable energy and charisma, and was eager to interact directly with her fans, who returned the vibes. She pointed out particularly well-dressed folks in the crowd and invited them to come on stage with her and dance to “Look,” gesturing to them one by one in time with the line, “It’s a look.” Her more popular songs — “Money,” “Attitude,” “Girl Blunt,” “Carry Anne” — were received with explosive energy, but many members of the audience could rap along to every word of her lesser-known songs as well. At the end of her set, she left us with one word: “Start.” <em>—Mika Simoncelli</em></p>

            <p><strong>Deeper</strong></p>
            
            <p>The local Chicago band Deeper played a tight, well-received set to open day two of the festival. The crowd was large and energetic for this 1 p.m. performance, and the band delivered. We were particularly impressed by drummer Shiraz Bhatti, who drove the group’s songs forward decisively and energetically. Frontman Nic Grohl sang with feeling about difficult topics, though chose to stay silent between songs, letting the music speak for itself. Deeper’s excellent set unfortunately ended five minutes early due to thunderstorm warnings, which held up the following sets by 20 minutes. <em>—Mika Simoncelli</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>700 Bliss</strong></p>
            
            <p>700 Bliss rolled with the thunder. Palm’s set had just been canceled; clouds kept gathering. It was good weather for translating the abrasive, club-adjacent dissonance of the duo’s debut album <em>Nothing To Declare</em> into performance. Producer DJ Haram and rapper/poet Moor Mother stalked around the stage, leaning into each other and into the noise. “Anthology” — a solid studio track — came fully alive, pulsing with the sheer force of their will. “I feel like dancing,” Moor Mother snarled over and over: an exultation or a threat. <em>—Benjy Wall-Feng</em></p>

            <p><strong>MJ Lenderman</strong></p>
            
            <p>MJ Lenderman was the final act to perform through light rain on Saturday before the festival was shut down for several hours. “I don’t think we’ve ever played for this many people before,” he told the crowd before launching into a slowed-down, simmering rendition of “Tastes Just Like it Costs” from 2022’s <em>Boat Songs</em>. It was a strong set, with the six musicians on stage playing seamlessly together — we were particularly impressed by the two drum sets and the pedal steel guitar, adding energetic layers to the powerful electric guitar at the core of his songs. <em>—Mika Simoncelli</em></p>

            <p><strong>Yaya Bey</strong></p>
            
            <p>The Blue Stage was lined with trees and sequestered away from the main part of the park. And who knows why but all the acts we saw here were crackling, larger than life, hidden from the dudes in Bon Iver beanies wandering the grounds. Yaya Bey was no exception: The Brooklyn singer-songwriter was maybe the most effortlessly charismatic performer on a day full of them. Backed by a keyboard player, drummer, and bassist — all virtuosic in their own right — she glided through genre and tempo changeups like they were nothing, pausing to talk to the crowd about rest (“All I do for you is just extra”), labor (“Everybody should boycott and strike”), and her dress slipping (“I’m iconic now. All of Chicago knows I have pretty titties”). <em>—Benjy Wall-Feng</em></p>

            <p><strong>Charlotte & Bolis</strong></p>
            
            <p>The crowd at the Blue Stage was ready to dance when they arrived for Charlotte Adigéry and Bolis Pupul's set, and the duo's playful presence kept them dancing through the whole thing, with an energetic peak during an extended mix of “Paténipat.” It might have seemed like the central onomatopoeia of “HAHA” — a twisting, bursting laugh buoyed by a club rhythm — was a loop or a sample, but nope: just Adigéry’s astonishing vocal work, which she delivered on stage without missing a beat. Throughout it, Pupul and Adigéry’s chemistry shone, letting them bounce ideas off the crowd and each other to riotous effect. <em>—Mika Simoncelli & Benjy Wall-Feng</em></p>

            <p><strong>Rachika Nayar</strong></p>
            
            <p>Palm had been moved to Sunday because of the previous day’s rain, so people drifted back and forth between the two sets. Rachika Nayar’s recorded music is celestial but also often solitary, the sound of one person layering ambience and noise higher and higher until something bursts. At Pitchfork she had a band: a cellist and vocalist who she introduced as the Bimbo and the Twink. (“I’m the Dyke,” she explained to thunderous applause.) For most of the set Nayar pulled double duty, DJing behind a mess of cables and coming out to layer on more guitar, and the connection between the three musicians made their sound impossibly huge. At the end they all hugged and kissed :) <em>—Benjy Wall-Feng</em></p>

            <p><strong>Jockstrap</strong></p>
            
            <p>Georgia Ellery and Taylor Skye came running out to the <em>Succession</em> theme, but the vibes were maybe more <em>Breakfast Club</em>: the singer in her gold bodysuit dancing on one half of the stage, the producer in his white crewneck slouched over the keys on the other half, joining forces to make something technically stunning and a little tongue-in-cheek. Ellery conducted the crowd with her violin bow on the gorgeous “Concrete Over Water.” On their standout performance of “The City,” Skye left his perch and crouched behind Ellery, shifting her pitch to new and frankly unhinged places as she reached the song’s climax. <em>—Mika Simoncelli & Benjy Wall-Feng</em></p>

            <p><strong>illuminati hotties</strong></p>
            
            <p>Not sure how better to describe it: People were in love with illuminati hotties. Frontwoman Sarah Tudzin led the crowd in woozy, debaucherous singalongs of “MMMOOOAAAAAYAYA” (“Love me, fight me, choke me, bite me”) and “freequent letdown” (“I’m always letting everyone down / I’m always letting everyone know I’m down”), but they all knew the words already. The band tore through old hits and new ones, including their most recent single, “Truck,” and Tudzin jumped around, shredded, spun into ecstasy. <em>—Mika Simoncelli & Benjy Wall-Feng</em></p>

            <p><strong>Hurray for the Riff Raff</strong></p>
            
            <p>On the Blue Stage on Sunday, Alynda Mariposa Segarra and their band turned the midtempo songs from <em>LIFE ON EARTH</em>, their most recent album, into something to dance to. A harder-rocking version of single “RHODODENDRON,” a shimmering extended coda on the end of “SAGA.” A new song, “Snake Plant,” that could have been a cut off <em>LIFE ON EARTH</em>. The highlight of the set was “nightqueen,” an aching ballad about displacement where, on the studio version, poet Ocean Vuong delivers the spoken-word bridge: “I don’t think energy dies; it’s just transformed.” Segarra transformed that part into something new, an urgent, soaring call to arms. That was the point of their live set and maybe really all live music: to take straightforward assessments of place — life on Earth is long; living in the city is hard — and deliver them with enough force, nuance, and wisdom to effect rapture. <em>—Benjy Wall-Feng</em></p>

            <p><strong>Kelela</strong></p>
            
            <p>Kelela was one of a few acts at Pitchfork who was completely alone on the stage; good, because she filled it up. On Sunday she mostly ran through songs from her recent album <em>Raven</em>, beginning with the slow opening track “Washed Away” and moving fluidly across the stage. She was haloed by a spotlight on the gorgeous, mercurial “Raven,” and on “Bruises” wreathed in violet smoke, ribbons streaming like water from her hands. The crowd was dancing for real. “Thank you so much for coming out and being vulnerable in your listening,” she told us, and that was the festival. <em>—Benjy Wall-Feng</em></p>
